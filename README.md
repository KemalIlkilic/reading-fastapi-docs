# FastAPI Documentation Explorer

This repository is a companion to the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) where I explore and work through various topics covered in the docs, focusing on each concept one at a time. It's designed to help me—and potentially others—deepen understanding of FastAPI by implementing examples and experiments alongside the official documentation.

## About

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It’s fast to code, has automatic interactive API documentation, and supports data validation right out of the box.

This repository serves as a practical sandbox to:

- Practice concepts from the FastAPI documentation.
- Test and document code samples.
- Explore each topic sequentially, allowing focused learning.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-docs-explorer.git
   cd fastapi-docs-explorer
